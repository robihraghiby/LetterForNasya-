# 💌 Letter for Nasya

> **Hey Nasya,**  
>  
> I don’t really know when things started to change — when our simple conversations turned into something I look forward to every single day.  
> There’s something about you that I can’t quite explain… maybe it’s the way you bring calm into every moment, or the way your smile quietly heals the tired parts of me.  
>  
> Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot — about us, and about these feelings I can no longer hide.  
> I don’t want to just be someone who’s “close” to you without meaning.  
> I want to be someone you can rely on — someone who stays through laughter and silence, through good days and bad ones.  
>  
> I know that love isn’t just about sweet words or promises; it’s about two people who choose to grow, learn, and walk through life together.  
> And I’m ready for that — as long as it’s with you.  
>  
> So, with all the honesty and warmth in my heart...  
> **will you be my girlfriend?** 💖  
>  
> — **R** 🌙
